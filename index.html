Q: What is Leverage and Margin?<br>
A: 
<h2>What Leverage and Margin Mean</h2>
Leverage allows traders to borrow money from the broker to open larger positions than their actual balance. 
For example, with 1:100 leverage, $100 can control a $10,000 trade.<br>
Margin is the amount of your own money set aside as a security deposit for open trades. 
Higher leverage means less margin is required, but risk increases because price movements have a stronger impact on your balance.<br><br>
<h2>How a Margin Call Happens</h2>
When the market moves against your open trades, your account equity (balance plus profit or loss) drops. 
As it approaches the margin used, the margin level (Equity ÷ Margin × 100%) decreases. 
If it falls below the broker’s set threshold (e.g., 100% or 50%), a margin call occurs or positions may be automatically closed.<br>

Example:<br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Balance</th>
    <th>Leverage</th>
    <th>Trade Size</th>
    <th>Margin Used</th>
    <th>Margin Level</th>
    <th>Status</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>$1,000</td>
    <td>1:100</td>
    <td>$50,000</td>
    <td>$500</td>
    <td>200%</td>
    <td>Safe</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Equity: $600</td>
    <td>1:100</td>
    <td>$50,000</td>
    <td>$500</td>
    <td>120%</td>
    <td>Getting Close</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Equity: $450</td>
    <td>1:100</td>
    <td>$50,000</td>
    <td>$500</td>
    <td>90%</td>
    <td>Margin Call Triggered</td>
  </tr>
</table><br>

Formula:<br>
Margin Level = (Equity ÷ Margin) × 100%<br><br>

In short, leverage magnifies both profits and losses. If open losses become too large, available margin decreases, the margin level drops, and the broker may issue a margin call or close trades automatically.

      <li class="list-item" data-description="<b>Q:</b> What is IRA, ROTH IRA, and 401k?<br><b>A:
        <p><strong>Traditional IRA</strong> allows individuals to contribute pre-tax income toward investments that can grow tax-deferred until withdrawal. It’s ideal for traders who want to lower taxable income today while compounding untaxed growth until retirement. Withdrawals after age 59½ are taxed as ordinary income.</p>
        <p><strong>Roth IRA</strong> is designed for long-term, tax-free growth. Contributions are made with after-tax money, and all trading gains—whether from forex, stocks, or other investments—are completely tax-free when withdrawn at retirement. This structure is powerful for active traders who expect higher future income, since all future gains are shielded from taxes.</p>
        <p><strong>401(k)</strong> accounts are employer-sponsored and also grow tax-deferred. Most 401(k) plans invest in mutual funds, but some include a “brokerage window” that lets employees directly trade stocks or ETFs. When leaving a job, traders often roll their 401(k) into a Self-Directed IRA, unlocking access to forex and alternative assets.</p>">What is IRA, ROTH IRA, and 401k?</li>
      <li class="list-item" data-description="<b>Q:</b> Using Retirement Accounts in Forex Trading?<br><b>A:</b>
<h2>IRA • Roth IRA • 401(k)</h2>
<p>How active traders can build tax-advantaged wealth through self-directed structures.</p>

<p>You can use your retirement accounts — including Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, and 401(k) — to trade forex through a Self-Directed Custodian.
This allows you to grow trading profits tax-deferred (IRA/401k) or tax-free (Roth IRA) instead of paying annual taxes on each profitable trade.</p>
<p>If the current IRA custodian does not permit or directly facilitate forex trading, clients need to open a <em>Self-Directed IRA</em> through a specialized custodian that allows alternative assets such as forex, crypto, or futures. The Self-Directed IRA gives you the flexibility to link with an approved forex broker, while keeping all trades and funds inside the IRA structure for IRS compliance. This can be done through their existing custodian, if supported but if not, the client might need to open a new IRA with a custodian that does.</p>
<h2>Account Comparison for Forex Trading</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Account Type</th><th>Tax Treatment</th><th>Withdrawal Rules</th><th>Forex Eligibility</th><th>Ideal Use</th></tr>
<tr><td>Traditional IRA</td><td>Contributions are pre-tax → growth is tax-deferred; taxed at withdrawal</td><td>Penalty before 59½</td><td>Yes, with a self-directed custodian</td><td>Long-term traders seeking lower taxable income today</td></tr>
<tr><td>Roth IRA</td><td>Contributions after-tax → all future growth is tax-free</td><td>Tax-free after 59½</td><td>Yes, self-directed only</td><td>Traders expecting higher income later (maximize future tax-free growth)</td></tr>
<tr><td>401(k)</td><td>Employer-sponsored, tax-deferred growth</td><td>Penalty before 59½ unless rollover</td><td>Limited: needs to be rolled into a Self-Directed IRA for forex</td><td>Employees rolling over funds for more control</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Key Benefits of Using a Retirement Account in Forex Trading</h2>
<h3>Tax Shield on Trading Profits</h3>
<p>Forex profits are normally taxed as ordinary income (up to 37% in the U.S.).</p>
<p>Inside a Traditional IRA or 401(k) → taxes are deferred until retirement.</p>
<p>Inside a Roth IRA → profits are never taxed when withdrawn correctly.</p>

<p>Example:<br>
$100,000 account earning 12% annually for 10 years</p>
<ul>
<li>Taxable account: ~$233,000 after taxes</li>
<li>IRA/Roth: ~$310,000 retained (no tax drag)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Faster Compound Growth</h3>
<p>By avoiding yearly taxation, gains are fully reinvested — leading to exponential growth over time. Every dollar stays working inside the account until withdrawal.</p>

<h3>Broader Diversification</h3>
<p>Forex allows exposure to global currencies (USD, EUR, JPY, GBP, etc.), reducing reliance on traditional stocks and bonds.
This makes the IRA or 401(k) portfolio more resilient to U.S. market downturns.</p>

<h3>Retirement-Focused Risk Management</h3>
<p>Trading inside a retirement account encourages long-term discipline, controlled leverage, and structured position sizing. Because the funds are protected by retirement restrictions, impulsive withdrawals are less likely.</p>

<h3>Regulatory & Custodial Oversight</h3>
<p>Assets are held by an IRS-approved custodian under the IRA/401k structure. This provides both asset protection and reporting compliance (Forms 5498, 1099-R, etc.). Funds remain legally distinct from personal assets.</p>

<h2>Important Considerations</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Limitation</th><th>Details</th></tr>
<tr><td>No personal use</td><td>You cannot personally guarantee loans, use margin from your own funds, or commingle money.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Margin restrictions</td><td>Some custodians limit or disallow leverage due to IRS debt-financing rules (UBTI).</td></tr>
<tr><td>Withdrawal penalties</td><td>Withdrawals before 59½ trigger taxes + 10% penalty unless qualified exception.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Custodian compatibility</td><td>Only self-directed custodians allow forex; major brokerages (Fidelity, Schwab) do not.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Possible UBTI exposure</td><td>Using borrowed funds inside the IRA may trigger Unrelated Business Taxable Income.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Example Strategy Path</h2>
<p>Scenario:<br>
John, age 45, rolls his $150,000 401(k) into a Self-Directed IRA with a custodian that supports forex.
He opens a trading account titled “Midland Trust Company FBO John Doe IRA #1034921” and connects it to a regulated broker.</p>
<p>He trades EUR/USD and GBP/USD moderately, earning 10% yearly.
After 10 years → $389,000 balance, no taxes paid until retirement.<br>
If done in a taxable account → ~$310,000 after taxes.</p>

<h2>Custodians Commonly Used for Forex Trading IRAs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Midland Trust Company — allows Forex & Futures (Self-Directed IRA)</li>
<li>Equity Trust Company — collaborates with brokers for forex access</li>
<li>IRA Financial Trust — specializes in alternative assets (crypto, forex, etc.)</li>
<li>Kingdom Trust — supports global trading structures</li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary Table</h2>
<table>
<tr><th>Benefit</th><th>Traditional IRA</th><th>Roth IRA</th><th>401(k)</th></tr>
<tr><td>Tax on Growth</td><td>Deferred</td><td>None</td><td>Deferred</td></tr>
<tr><td>Early Withdrawal Penalty</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes (before 59½)</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Forex Access</td><td>Self-Directed</td><td>Self-Directed</td><td>Via Rollover</td></tr>

<tr><td>Compounding Advantage</td><td>⭐⭐⭐</td><td>⭐⭐⭐⭐</td><td>⭐⭐⭐</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
<p>Trading forex within a retirement account (IRA, Roth IRA, or 401k rollover) lets you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep all profits growing inside a tax shelter</li>
<li>Diversify beyond stocks and ETFs</li>
<li>Legally protect assets</li>
<li>Build long-term wealth through active global strategies</li>
</ul>

<p>The key is finding the right custodian and broker pair that fully supports IRA forex accounts.</p>">

      Q: What are Equity Monitors?<br>
      A: Equity monitors let you trigger an alert or action when your account reaches a specific equity level, either above or below your current equity. You can choose actions such as sending an email alert, disabling copiers, or closing trades.<br><br>

The page has two tabs:<br>
      - Active: shows monitors currently running.<br>
      - Concluded: shows monitors that have triggered or were cancelled. You can create or cancel a monitor, but you cannot edit or delete it.<br><br>

Types of Equity Monitors<br> 

      1. Target Value – Triggers ABOVE your current equity at a specific value.<br>
      Example: Equity 10,000 → trigger at 11,000.<br>

      2. Target Percentage – Triggers ABOVE your current equity by percentage.<br>
      Example: Equity 10,000 → 10% increase = 11,000 (enter 110%).<br> 

      3. Protect Value – Triggers BELOW your current equity at a specific value.<br>
      Example: Equity 10,000 → trigger at 9,000.<br>

      4. Protect Percentage – Triggers BELOW your current equity by percentage.<br>
      Example: Equity 10,000 → 10% drop = 9,000 (enter 90%).<br><br>
